I have been Data Science and ML Instructor on Coursera and launched courses ( listed below ) 

**1. Data Visualization on BigQuery Data using Data Studio**

Through this course I taught learners/students the basics of Google Cloudâ€™s Data Studio, how to connect a Data Studio report to a BigQuery dataset, visualize it with charts and graphs, create and add customized filters, build dashboards and share it with your co-workers to make informed data-driven decisions.

_**Project Tasks :**_

1. By the end of Task 1, you will be able to understand how to sign up on Google Data Studio
2. By the end of Task 2, you will be able to learn how to establish connection between Data Studio and BigQuery
3. By the end of Task 3, you will be able to learn how to create beautiful visualizations
4. By the end of Task 4, you will be able to learn how to build scorecards, Geo Charts and Insightful dashboards
5. By the end of Task 5, you will be able to learn how to create, add customized filters, view your reports and share with anyone you want

**2. Data Visualization using Bokeh**

Through this course I taught learners/students the basics of Bokeh and create different plots and impressive data visualizations in detail. You will also learn Glyphs and how to Map geo data using Bokeh. Please note that you will need prior programming experience in Python. You will also need familiarity with Pandas. This is a practical, hands on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding of Pandas and Python.

_**Project Tasks :**_

1. By the end of Task 1, you will be able to install Bokeh
2. By the end of Task 2, you will be able to learn basics of Bokeh
3. By the end of Task 3, you will be able to learn plotting with Glyphs
4. By the end of Task 4, you will be able to learn different glyphs such as wedge, annular wedge and how to combine both line and circle Glyphs to create a     
   beautiful plot
5. By the end of Task 5, you will be able to create different plots in Bokeh
6. By the end of Task 6, you will be able to learn how to Map geo data using Bokeh

**3. Introduction to Big Query - SQL in Google Cloud Platform**

Through this course I taught learners/students how to formulate queries and Analyze bulk data using SQL at blazing-fast speeds on Google Cloud Platform. 

_**Project Tasks :**_

1. By the end of Task 1, you will be able to sign up on Google Cloud Platform and Load the data successfully.
2. By the end of Task 2, you will be able to implement SELECT, FROM and WHERE clauses
3. By the end of Task 3, you will be able to apply Alias, DATE and EXTRACT clauses
4. By the end of Task 4, you will be able to implement Aggregate Functions
5. By the end of Task 5, you will be able to implement GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY clauses
6. By the end of Task 6, you will be able to implement JOINS and UNION clauses
7. By the end of Task 7, you will be able to implement Analytical Functions
8. By the end of Task 8, you will be able to implement Common Expression Table
9. By the end of Task 9, you will be able to implement UNNEST Clause to deal with Nested Data

**4. Data Visualization using Plotly**

Through this course I taught learners/students how to do Data Visualization using Plotly. Plotly is a python graphing library which is used to make interactive, publication-quality graphs. It allows users to import, copy and paste, or stream data to be analyzed and visualized.In this project you will learn how to create beautiful visualizations using Plotly constructs. This guided project is for anyone who wants to learn data visualization or already in the data science field.

_**Project Tasks:**_

1. By the end of the Task 1, you will be able to learn the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis, Plotly and install it on your colab notebook
2. By the end of the Task 2, you will be able to learn how to import necessary libraries and visualize data through simple as well as multi line plots with 
   different markers using plotly
3. By the end of the Task 3, you will be able to visualize data through barplots, Area Chart and Stacked Area Chart using plotly
4. By the end of the Task 4, you will be able to visualize data through Pie Chart and Multilevel Piechart using plotly
5. By the end of the Task 5, you will be able to visualize data through scatter plot using plotly

**5. Data Visualization using Plotnine and ggplot**

Through this course I taught learners/students how to do data Visualization using Plotnine and ggplot. Plotnine library is a powerful python visualization library based on R's ggplot2 package and a great package to make professional plots. It has the grammar of graphics from ggplot and is used to add layers that control geometries, facets, themes and many constructs. In this project you will learn how to create beautiful visualizations using plotnine and gglot constructs. This guided project is for anyone who wants to learn data visualization or already in the data science field and Machine Learning.

_**Project Tasks :**_

1. By the end of the Task 1, you will be able to learn the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis, Plotnine-ggplot and install it on your colab notebook
2. By the end of the Task 2, you will be able to learn how to import necessary libraries and visualize data through simple as well as multi line plots using 
   plotnine and ggplot
3. By the end of the Task 3, you will be able to visualize data through bar plot and Scatter plot using plotnine and ggplot
4. By the end of the Task 4, you will be able to visualize data through Density plot and Histogram using plotnine and ggplot
5. By the end of the Task 5, you will be able to visualize data through Box plot and Violin plot using plotnine and ggplot
